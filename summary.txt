# MedOptix Project Summary

## Completed Tasks

### ETL Pipeline Implementation
- Created a complete Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) pipeline for healthcare data
- Implemented data extraction from multiple CSV sources (appointments, feedback, service, staff logs)
- Built data transformation and cleaning processes
- Developed database loading functionality into SQLite
- Implemented data verification with row count validation

### Data Sources Integrated
- Appointments data
- Patient feedback data
- Service/equipment data
- Staff logs data

### Database Implementation
- Created SQLite database schema
- Implemented data tables with appropriate relationships
- Verified data integrity with row count validation
- Set up temporary database for real-time data streaming

### Analysis and Visualization
- Generated various analytical plots:
  - Average patients by department
  - Equipment downtime analysis by department
  - Equipment downtime trends
  - No-show rates analysis
  - Patient satisfaction analysis (boxplot)
  - Staff-to-patient ratio analysis
  - Staff-patient correlation analysis
  - Wait time and satisfaction correlation
  - Wait time distribution (boxplot)
- Implemented A/B testing analysis with statistical tests:
  - Wait time comparison (Welch's t-test)
  - Satisfaction score analysis (Mann-Whitney U test)
  - No-show rate analysis (Chi-square test)
  - Patient throughput comparison
  - Staff efficiency metrics
  - Equipment downtime analysis
- Generated comprehensive insights with recommendations
- Created business-focused summary reports

### API Implementation
- Developed FastAPI backend with RESTful endpoints:
  - /appointments - Get all appointments
  - /staff - Get all staff logs
  - /service - Get all service data
  - /feedback - Get all feedback data
  - /insights - Get precomputed insights
  - /stream/appointments - Get real-time appointment data
- Implemented database integration using SQLAlchemy
- Added CORS configuration for frontend integration
- Created data models for API responses

### Real-time Data Streaming
- Implemented real-time data simulation system
- Created temporary database for streaming data
- Developed random appointment generator with realistic parameters
- Set up continuous data streaming with configurable intervals
- Integrated streaming with API for real-time dashboard updates

### Dashboard Implementation
- Built responsive React dashboard with Vite
- Implemented multiple dashboard views:
  - Overview Dashboard with KPI cards and appointment trends
  - A/B Testing Analysis for comparing treatment approaches
  - Department Statistics showing no-show rates, patient load vs staffing
  - Operational Insights with correlation analysis
  - Recommendations with data-driven implementation priorities
- Created reusable chart components using Recharts
- Implemented API integration with Axios
- Added mock data support for development and testing
- Styled with Tailwind CSS for responsive design

### Documentation
- Added comprehensive code documentation and comments
- Created detailed analysis logs
- Generated business-focused summary reports
- Produced A/B testing markdown report with executive summary
- Added README files with setup and usage instructions

### Infrastructure
- Organized project with modular structure
- Created separate scripts for extract, transform, and load operations
- Implemented data directory structure for raw and processed data
- Set up outputs directory for visualizations and reports
- Created separate client and server directories
- Implemented threading for concurrent operations

### A/B Testing Results
- Conducted comprehensive A/B testing comparing two healthcare service approaches
- Analyzed key metrics including:
  - Wait times (Group A: 17.58 min vs Group B: 17.68 min)
  - Satisfaction scores (Group A: 8.55/10 vs Group B: 8.53/10)
  - No-show rates (Group A: 5.77% vs Group B: 6.23%)
- Generated statistical significance tests for all metrics
- Produced detailed visualizations of A/B test results
- Created executive summary with actionable recommendations
- Identified Group A as slightly better performing across multiple metrics

### Correlation Analysis
- Analyzed correlation between wait time and patient satisfaction
- Studied relationship between staff count and patients seen
- Examined correlation between service time and no-show rates
- Generated scatter plots with regression lines for all correlations
- Produced statistical significance tests for all correlations

## Future Enhancements
- Implement machine learning models for predictive analytics
- Develop automated alerting system for operational metrics
- Enhance real-time dashboard with additional visualizations
- Expand A/B testing to include more treatment variables
- Integrate with electronic health record systems
- Implement natural language processing for patient feedback analysis
