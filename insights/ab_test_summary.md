# A/B Test Results Analysis

## Executive Summary

Our A/B testing analysis compared two different healthcare service approaches (Group A vs Group B) across multiple metrics including wait times, patient satisfaction, and appointment attendance. Overall, Group A demonstrated slightly better performance across these key healthcare metrics, though the differences were not statistically significant. Group A showed shorter average wait times (17.6 vs 17.7 minutes). Group A received higher satisfaction ratings. Group A experienced lower no-show rates (5.8% vs 6.2%). While no individual metric showed statistically significant differences, the consistent pattern of improvements in Group A suggests potential benefits that warrant further investigation and targeted implementation.

## Key Findings

### Wait Time Analysis

- Group A average wait time: 17.58 minutes
- Group B average wait time: 17.68 minutes
- Difference: 0.10 minutes (0.6% lower in Group A)
- Statistical significance: No (p-value: 0.8005)

### Satisfaction Score Analysis

- Group A average satisfaction: 8.55/10
- Group B average satisfaction: 8.53/10
- Difference: 0.03 points (0.3% higher in Group A)
- Statistical significance: No (p-value: 0.7931)

#### Satisfaction Score Distribution

| Score | Group A | Group B |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 1 | 0.3% | 0.4% |
| 2 | 0.3% | 0.3% |
| 3 | 0.5% | 1.0% |
| 4 | 1.7% | 1.3% |
| 5 | 2.9% | 2.5% |
| 6 | 5.0% | 5.7% |
| 7 | 10.6% | 11.0% |
| 8 | 16.4% | 16.0% |
| 9 | 26.9% | 26.0% |
| 10 | 35.5% | 35.8% |

### No-show Rate Analysis

- Group A no-show rate: 5.77%
- Group B no-show rate: 6.23%
- Difference: 0.46% (7.9% lower in Group A)
- Statistical significance: No (p-value: 0.4503)

## Recommendations

1. Consider piloting Group A's patient flow processes in high-volume departments to evaluate potential wait time improvements
2. Investigate the specific elements of Group A's patient experience that may contribute to higher satisfaction scores
3. Analyze Group A's appointment confirmation process and consider testing enhanced reminder protocols
4. Prioritize full implementation of Group A's approach across all departments, as it consistently outperformed in multiple metrics
5. Enhance data collection to include department-specific group assignments to enable more granular analysis of performance differences

## Caveats and Limitations

- The analysis assumes random assignment of patients to groups
- Results may be influenced by department-specific factors not captured in the analysis
- Correlation does not imply causation - further investigation is needed to confirm causal relationships
- The absence of statistical significance does not necessarily mean there is no effect, especially with smaller sample sizes
